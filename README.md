# Workday-Scheduler
## Project Description
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Main features in this application:

* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* Presented with time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* When the users click the time block, they can enter an event.
* When the users click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
* When the users refresh the page, the saved events persist.
